## Overview

The **Student Alcohol Consumption** project analyzes how factors like demographic background, academic performance, and social behavior impact alcohol consumption among students. We conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights and develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains the following features:

- **School**: student's school (binary: "GP" for Gabriel Pereira or "MS" for Mousinho da Silveira)
- **Sex**: gender of the student (binary: "F" for female or "M" for male)
- **Age**: student's age (numeric: from 15 to 22)
- **Family Size**: family size (binary: "LE3" if <=3 or "GT3" if >3)
- **Parents' Status**: cohabitation status of parents (binary: "T" if living together or "A" apart)
- **Weekday/Weekend Alcohol Consumption**: alcohol consumption (ordinal: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)
